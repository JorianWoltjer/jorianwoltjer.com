  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="text-dark">Here is a small bit of backstory about me and this website.</p>
  <h2>‚Ä¶ Me üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>
  <p>
    In my younger years, I was always a curious kid, wanting to know how everything worked. From watching science videos, and taking mechanical things
    apart, to eventually <b>finding programming</b> via <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. This was fascinating to me,
    making the computer do what you want. I did this for a while until eventually discovering this crazy world of "code" via YouTube tutorials from
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a>. While I had watched a lot with no clue what's going on, at
    one point I got started with the basics for real with <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, a Java-based programming
    language for making small visual programs. To me this was a whole new world opening up, generating complex patterns and interactive little games
    by just writing some lines of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this same time, my passion was in <b>graphics design</b>, specifically video editing. The complexity but flexability of Adobe After Effects
    fascinated me and it's what I did every chance I got. The more complex the effect, the more interesting it was to me. Its "expression language"
    was also technically the first programming language I used, although all I did with it back then was copy-pasting code from other people's
    projects.
    <br />
    As you may notice from this website, I still get enjoyment out of designing graphics like this CSS and my personal logo. This combines well with
    making things clear to understand, this is easier when it's pleasing to look at.
  </p>
  <p>
    All this love for programming was eventually transferred into hacking due to my best friend telling me about it after learning the basics during a
    summer vacation. We were just 16 years old at the time, but were already successfully finding and reporting many vulnerabilities in our
    <b>school's websites</b>. Whenever we learned a new technique from playing CTFs, we could almost always directly apply it to a school website,
    which was a great way to practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>CTF</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)" target="_blank">Capture The Flag</a>) was the next period of
    my life, putting almost all my free time into playing challenges, reading writeups and starting to write some of my own. I think this is the
    single best way to learn deep technical hacking skills. Because I often played alone, I had to learn all common categories in order to compete. I
    liked basically all of it, from crypto to web to binary exploitation. Eventually, I noticed, however, that I was best at web security. It's also
    what I started my journey with initially. I started to shift my whole focus to web security.<br />
    Another thing I found was that I really enjoyed creating writeups, explaining my thought process and the techniques taking note of the techniques
    I used to solve a challenge. Not only did it help others, but also myself to remember how I did something in the future. Eventually, just creating
    writeups wasn't enough and I got started on my biggest project yet: <a href="https://book.jorianwoltjer.com/" target="_blank">My Gitbook</a>. This
    includes essentially all the knowledge I gained from CTFs and my own experiments, and to this day I'm using and expanding it almost daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest milestone for me was finding a genuinely <b>novel technique</b> involving an XS-Leak vulnerability in something I was very familiar
    with: <a href="/blog/p/hacking/xs-leaking-flags-with-css-a-ctfd-0day" target="_blank">CTFd</a>. Many great hackers have likely looked at this but
    in my ignorence I decided to follow a rabbit hole anyway, which led to this very interesting discovery. Since then my focus has been on finding
    small new tricks that expand the boundaries of what's theoretically possible, and sharing that on my blog. All the while using my knowledge to
    hack and report vulnerabilities to real applications!
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I'm working as a full-time pentester at <a href="https://warpnet.nl/" target="_blank">Warpnet</a> and really enjoying the community.
  </p>
  <h2>‚Ä¶ This website üåê</h2>
  <p>
    What you're looking at right now is completely handmade HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Everything is served and generated using the Axum framework in
    Rust, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database. It's all hosted on my personal VPS with Cloudflare on top for caching and content delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
    I intentionally chose not to use any frontend framework this time around, as I have gained a lot of experience in Web Development over the years
    of hacking websites, and saw it as a fun challenge. It wasn't always like this, below are the largest iterations of technology stacks I went
    through:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>PHP</b>:
      <p>
        <i>
          The first useful programming project I ever did was this old version of my personal website, all the way back in 2021. This taught me a ton
          about frontend and backend development and most of the basics of how websites work. My love for graphics design could shine through CSS,
          although my thoughts were hard to put into code at that time.

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>NextJS + Axum</b>:<br />
      <p>
        <i>
          After a while, started to get sick of PHP's idiosyncrasies and decided I simply had to move to a more modern stack. The most popular
          framework for blogs at the time was NextJS, which was actually quite nice to work with. Although I wanted to avoid doing everything in that
          single framework, which led me to add a backend in Rust, the programming language I was learning at the time. While taking multiple weeks to
          complete due to the complexity of suddenly working on multiple systems communicating with each other, I learned a lot about both
          technologies and interaction between servers.

        </a>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>JavaScript + Axum</b>
      <p>
        <i>
          While the complexity was great for learning, I wanted to simplify things and choose a stack that made sense for a "simple" website like
          mine. That's what led me to simply keep the Axum (Rust) backend but render all HTML responses straight from there using simple templates and
          plain JavaScript. This only took a few days to complete because the basis was already there for the backend, and I had gained a lot more
          experience since which helped out in the frontend.
